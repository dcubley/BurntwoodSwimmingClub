## Implementation Guidelines

### Image Sourcing
1. **Authentic First**: Use real photos of your club, members, and coaches (with permission)
2. **Professional Photography**: Invest in 2-3 professional photo shoots per year
   - Spring: Learn-to-swim + Community portraits
   - Summer: Competition action + Podium moments
   - Fall: Coaching headshots + Facility refresher
3. **User-Generated Content**: Encourage members to share photos via secure portal
4. **Stock Photography**: Use high-quality stock only as temporary placeholders
   - Recommended: Unsplash (diverse swimmers), Pexels, or commissioned images
   - Avoid: Generic, obviously staged stock photos

### HTML Integration
- Use `<picture>` element with `srcset` for responsive images
- Include `alt` text describing the action/emotion, not just "swimmers in pool"
- Lazy load images below fold with `loading="lazy"`
- Provide image credit/attribution for UGC and stock photos

### Responsive Image Strategy
```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 1024px)" srcset="hero-action-1-landscape.jpg 1920w">
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="hero-action-1-landscape.jpg 1200w">
  <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="hero-action-1-vertical.jpg 600w">
  <img src="hero-action-1-landscape.jpg" alt="Freestyle swimmer mid-stroke, capturing power and technique">
</picture>
```

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Alt Text**: Describe action and emotion, include diverse representation
- **Captions**: For testimonial/quote photos, include name and achievement
- **Contrast**: Ensure text overlays have sufficient contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- **Diversity**: Represent all age groups (8-70+), genders, ethnicities, abilities
- **Consent**: Ensure written permission from all identifiable people

## Current Placeholder Strategy

Until authentic images are available, use:
1. **Service**: Placeholder service (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels)
2. **Search Terms**: "Freestyle swimmer mid-stroke," "swimming lesson," "youth athletes"
3. **Attribution**: Credit photographers in footer or image data
4. **Update Plan**: Replace with authentic photos as they're collected
